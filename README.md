### Amber - ML Library Written in C++
A simple C++ machine learning library with an autograd engine. It is written on top of xtensor, a C++ library for numerical analysis on multi-dimensional arrays (It is pretty much numpy). It is consisted of Layer, Loss, Optimizer, Parameter, and Sequential classes that makeup the basic architecture of a ML library. The purpose of the project was mainly for me to understand machine learning better from an architectural and mathematical approach. I am planning on rewriting this project in python in the future with accelerators as that is an area I have not yet explored.
